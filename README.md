Research Agent 
This repository contains the code and documentation for an AI Research Agent designed to assist researchers in efficiently navigating academic literature and generating research-related content. Leveraging IBM Cloud Lite services and IBM Granite models, this intelligent agent aims to streamline the research process by automating data collection, preprocessing, analysis, and report generation.

Project Overview
The AI Research Agent acts as an intelligent partner for researchers. It understands research ideas, identifies relevant academic papers, summarizes key information, organizes references, and assists in drafting research content. This significantly reduces the tedious manual work involved in research, allowing users to focus on higher-level conceptualization and analysis.

Problem Statement
Traditional research often involves time-consuming and repetitive tasks such as searching for relevant papers, reading through vast amounts of text, summarizing findings, and organizing citations. This inefficiency can hinder the pace of discovery and divert researchers from their core intellectual pursuits.

 Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is an AI Research Agent built on IBM Cloud Lite services and IBM Granite models. This system utilizes data analytics and machine learning to address research inefficiencies through the following components:

Data Collection: Gathers historical and real-time data, including academic papers, articles, and other relevant factors related to a given research topic.

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses collected data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and extracts relevant features for analysis.

Machine Learning Algorithm: Implements a machine learning model (potentially advanced NLP models from IBM Granite) to understand research questions, summarize papers, and generate reports.

Deployment: Deploys the solution on a scalable and reliable platform with a user-friendly interface for real-time information access.

Evaluation: Assesses model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), with continuous monitoring for fine-tuning.

üõ†Ô∏è System Development Approach
The development of the Research Agent follows a structured approach:

System Requirements: Defines hardware specifications, software dependencies, and infrastructure needs.

Library Requirements: Identifies and lists necessary libraries for data manipulation (e.g., Pandas), natural language processing (e.g., NLTK, spaCy), and machine learning (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).

Technology Stack: Emphasizes the use of IBM Cloud Lite services and IBM Granite for building and deploying the system.

Algorithm & Deployment
Algorithm Selection: Chooses a machine learning algorithm based on the problem statement and data characteristics, with advanced NLP models from IBM Granite being ideal for summarization and content generation.

Data Input: Utilizes historical academic literature, research papers, and other relevant factors for training and operation.

Training Process: Explains how the chosen algorithm is trained, including techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for optimization.

Prediction/Generation Process: Details how the trained algorithm generates summaries and reports, handling real-time user queries.

Setup and Deployment (from resarch ai agent.ipynb)
To set up and deploy the AI Service, follow the steps outlined in the resarch ai agent.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. Key steps include:

Set up the environment:

Connect to WML by providing your IBM Cloud personal API key.

Connect to a Watsonx.ai space where the AI Service will be hosted.

Create the AI service function:

Define the gen_ai_service function, which utilizes langchain_ibm, ibm_watsonx_ai, and langgraph to create a React agent.

This function integrates with IBM Granite models (e.g., meta-llama/llama-3-3-70b-instruct) and uses tools like Google Search.

Test locally:

The notebook provides code to test the AI Service function locally before deployment.

Store and deploy the AI Service:

Store the AI service in your Watsonx.ai repository.

Define request and response schemas.

Deploy the stored AI Service as an online deployment.

Test deployed AI Service:

Run a test against the deployed AI Service using its deployment ID.

Usage
Once deployed, the Research Agent can be interacted with via its user-friendly interface. As shown in The test case.pdf, you can pose research questions, and the agent will provide detailed, relevant responses by leveraging its integrated tools and language models.

Future Scope
The project has several areas for future enhancement:

Additional Data Sources: Incorporate data beyond academic papers, such as patents, clinical trial data, and industry reports.

Algorithm Optimization: Further optimize the core algorithm for improved performance and more accurate results.

Integration of Emerging Technologies: Expand to integrate with technologies like edge computing or more advanced machine learning techniques.

Multi-Modal Analysis: Analyze and synthesize information from different data types, including images, audio, and video.

Collaboration Features: Support collaboration among multiple researchers on a single project.
